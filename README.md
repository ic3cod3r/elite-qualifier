## NOTICE
When you run the program, and you get a correction in the GUI window, the correction will also be placed in the console, where it will allow you to copy the corrected version and past it into your document, it will also tell you the time it took to correct the word(s). The correction in the console is also a little different from the correction in the GUI window, as the correction in the console adds periods and capitalization, whilst the correction in the GUI window does not. This autocorrect is not complete, for example; it will capatalize the letter after a period, but not after an exclamation point or a question mark, or any other symbols. Also, the sentence format correction will only appear in the console, not in the GUI window, the GUI window will only show the corrected words, NOT the corrected sentence format (i.e. capatalization, added periods, etc.)
## Background
